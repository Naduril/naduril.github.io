![Heyy](/images/photo_about.jpg "Happy to see you here")

Welcome.

I am Celia Alessandrini. I am a 27 years old student. I'm about to start study programmation in october 2022 at the school ETNA. 

I don't know how yet, but I will try to do some blogging content about my journey from noob to maybe front end developper. Or maybe video games developper. Or a cybersecurity profession... Hard to make a choice at the moment...!

With this idea, and because I never touched any development tools nor programmation language in my life... I'm trying to start my firsts projects. This is it, the first one : celiales.fr is born ! It might be ugly at the moment but i'm putting all my soul in it ! 

I hope you will find one day my resume (Curriculum Vitae) somewhere on this website and a portfolio (when I will have some shiny stuff to show!). And maybe some other things on my other passions... 

I think I have said the essential, have a really nice day, visitor ! 

Celia.
