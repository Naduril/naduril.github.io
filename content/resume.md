Hi again ! 

If you're here, i hope it's because you're interested in my profile. 

I'm looking for a work experience. Indeed, as part of my Bachelor at ETNA school, I would like a work-study experience as front end developer or in any area that could be interesting in my professional project. This would be between January 2023 (it can be sooner) and at least until June 2023 (6 months minimum), but I will be happy to stay (with you maybe?) longer ;)

Here is what i'll study at school :

Development in C, Java, Mobile ; algorithmic.
Web Development: HTML/CSS/JS, PHP, API creation.
Systems Administration : Linux/Windows, Web server.
Administration/conception of Data Bases: MySQL.
Network : Conception, securization.

In any case, don't hesitate to reach out to me !
